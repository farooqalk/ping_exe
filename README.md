# ping_exe

An enhanced ping utility that is compatible with Windows 10.

This tool is able to scan the network, get the MAC Address of each device on the network, 
and identify the vendor/manufacturer (assuming anonymous MAC is not enabled).

It also has other commands to "filter"/manipulate results.
